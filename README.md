# BreakingBadFans

## Notes

1. I have used Uni directonal VIP as architecture, this allows one way flow i.e. View -> Interactor -> Presenter -> View. It's easy to understand and very testable.
2. I have declare all the types with protocols so that it's easier to test and replace with mocks when testing.
3. Added tests for almost everything (still could have add more, but I think this will be enough to show my skills.)
4. Using SDWebImage as dependency to load images (easy to use)
